SAP to KAFKA Demo
This is code copied from the SAP JCo 3.0 zip file downloaded from SAP.  
I've changed a few lines to connect to my EC2 instance.  

I used this code to test my JCo setup.

```script
javac -cp ~/sapjco30/sapjco3.jar StepByStepServer.java

java -cp ~/sapjco30/sapjco3.jar:. StepByStepServer
```
