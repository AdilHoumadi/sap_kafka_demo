SAP to KAFKA Demo


This code is used for consuming messages from KAFKA and call SAP.



Flow:
- Message produced on KAFKA Topic
- Java Client consumes message
- Java Client calls SAP RFC
- SAP RFC replies with the same text as echo


I've combined the code from SAP example and KAFKA consumer example found online.

The code is old with depricated methods, but it works.
